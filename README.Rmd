This package is a (naive) tokeniser of phonetic transcriptions in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/content/ipa-chart) (IPA).

With phonetisr, you can parse texts and word lists transcribed in IPA and tokenise them into phones so that you can perform quantitative analyses.

## Installation

Phonetisr is on CRAN so you can install it with `install.packages("phonetisr")`.

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("stefanocoretta/phonetisr@devel")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(phonetisr)

# IPA strings to be tokenised
ipa <- c("pʰãkʰ", "tʰum̥", "ɛkʰɯ")

# List of character sequences to be considered single phones
ph <- c("pʰ", "tʰ", "kʰ", "ã", "m̥")

# Tokenise strings
phonetise(ipa, multi = ph)
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Scan for illegal (non-IPA) characters.
- [x] Provide a list of default multi-character phones.
- [ ] Functions for data import/export.
- [ ] Ignore diacritics.
